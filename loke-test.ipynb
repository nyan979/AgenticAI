It is ruled by the living god who is known as the [Emperor of Mankind](/wiki/Emperor_of_Mankind \"Emperor of Mankind\").\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there are other humanoid species classified as Imperial citizens, mainly [mutant](/wiki/Mutant \"Mutant\") offshoots of genetic base-line Humans who are known as [Abhumans](/wiki/Abhuman \"Abhuman\") and include such Human sub-species as the [Ogryns](/wiki/Ogryn \"Ogryn\"), [Ratlings](/wiki/Ratling \"Ratling\") and [Squats](/wiki/Squat \"Squat\").\n",
      "\n",
      "The founder and ruler of the Imperium is the god-like Emperor of Mankind, the most powerful Human [psyker](/wiki/Psyker \"Psyker\") ever born. The Emperor founded the Imperium over 10,000 [Terran](/wiki/Terran \"Terran\") years ago in the late 30th Millennium during the [Unification Wars](/wiki/Unification_Wars \"Unification Wars\") on [Old Earth](/wiki/Old_Earth \"Old Earth\") following the apocalyptic period in Human history known as the [Age of Strife](/wiki/Age_of_Strife \"Age of Strife\").\n",
      "\n",
      "The Emperor continues, at least nominally, to rule the Imperium as both its political master and its primary religious figure. However, His badly damaged body was interred within the [cybernetic](/wiki/Cybernetic \"Cybernetic\") life support mechanisms of the arcane device known as the [Golden Throne](/wiki/Golden_Throne \"Golden Throne\") following His mortal wounding during the ancient interstellar civil war of the [Horus Heresy](/wiki/Horus_Heresy \"Horus Heresy\").\n",
      "\n",
      "Because of this terrible fate, the Emperor is incapable of interacting with others on a day-to-day basis and has left the basic governance of His Imperium to the [Senatorum Imperialis](/wiki/Senatorum_Imperialis \"Senatorum Imperialis\"), an oligarchic ruling council of the most powerful [noble](/wiki/Highborn \"Highborn\") lords and adepts in the galaxy. The Senatorum Imperialis is currently led by the Emperor's genetic son, [Primarch](/wiki/Primarch \"Primarch\") [Roboute Guilliman](/wiki/Roboute_Guilliman \"Roboute Guilliman\"), who chairs the council and directs Imperial policy as the [Lord Commander of the Imperium](/wiki/Lord_Commander_of_the_Imperium \"Lord Commander of the Imperium\") and [Imperial Regent](/wiki/Imperial_Regent \"Imperial Regent\").\n",
      "\n",
      "The Imperium of Man is a war-torn stellar empire, teetering on the brink of collapse. For 10,000 Terran years it has been ruled by the deathless Emperor, a being of almost limitless [psychic](/wiki/Psychic \"Psychic\") power, to whom thousands of souls are sacrificed daily to provide Him the psychic strength to [maintain the Imperium's lines of communication and transport](/wiki/Astronomican \"Astronomican\").\n",
      "\n",
      "The peoples of the Imperium live in a galaxy where [Daemons](/wiki/Daemons \"Daemons\") are real, [mutation](/wiki/Mutation \"Mutation\") is frequent and death is a constant companion. To be alive in the 41st Millennium is to know that the universe is a terrifying and hostile place. It is a place where you are but one amongst billions and, no matter how heroic your death, you will not be missed. A truly vast domain, the Imperium is spread amongst the many stars of the galaxy. Its territories encompass untold millions of stars and countless trillions of Human lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "In its name, terrible wars are fought and desperate sacrifices made, yet even this river of carnage and blood is a small price to pay, for the Imperium is the guardian of Humanity. Were it to pass into nothingness, so too would the Human species, destroyed by enemies uncountable, to the braying laughter of the [Dark Gods](/wiki/Dark_Gods \"Dark Gods\").\n",
      "\n",
      "The Imperium is the largest and currently most powerful political entity in the galaxy, consisting of at least 1,000,000 Human-settled [worlds](/wiki/Worlds \"Worlds\") dispersed across most of the Milky Way galaxy. Consequently, an Imperial planet might be separated from its closest neighbour by hundreds or even thousands of light years.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a stellar empire, the size of the Imperium cannot be measured in terms of contiguous territory, but only in the number of planetary systems under its control. However, most Humans in the galaxy have little day-to-day contact with the government of the Imperium unless they serve in one of its bureaucratic adepta or run afoul of its various protectors, such as the [Inquisition](/wiki/Inquisition \"Inquisition\") or the [Adeptus Arbites](/wiki/Adeptus_Arbites \"Adeptus Arbites\").\n",
      "\n",
      "The Imperium is primarily an interstellar tribute empire, allowing its member worlds to largely govern themselves as long as they recognise the authority of the Emperor and His servants and support the state religion, the [Imperial Cult](/wiki/Imperial_Cult \"Imperial Cult\"), which holds the Emperor to be the one, true god of Mankind. Every world of the Imperium must also pay the Imperial taxes levied on them in the form of troops and materiel that is known as the [Imperial Tithe](/wiki/Imperial_Tithe \"Imperial Tithe\"). These resources go to the service of the [Astra Militarum](/wiki/Astra_Militarum \"Astra Militarum\") and the [Navis Imperialis](/wiki/Navis_Imperialis \"Navis Imperialis\"), the armed forces which keep the Imperium united and safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Imperial Tithe supports the overall economy of the Imperium by redistributing resources where needed, usually to shore up one region of the Imperium where conflict is raging by drawing resources from more peaceful [sectors](/wiki/Sector \"Sector\").\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, the Imperium promotes the development of a neo-feudal political system, which the [High Lords of Terra](/wiki/High_Lords_of_Terra \"High Lords of Terra\") and the Inquisition have long believed to be the most stable form of Human government. There are few Human-settled worlds in the galaxy where any but the most wealthy [nobles](/wiki/Highborn \"Highborn\") have any say in the government of their planet, and the Imperial establishment generally characterises any movements toward \"democracy,\" self-rule or the overthrow of the neo-feudal system as outright [heresy](/wiki/Heresy \"Heresy\") against the divine plan of the God-Emperor.\n",
      "\n",
      "This intense need for political stability and the growing military demands upon the Imperial system presented by the myriad and growing threats of the 41st Millennium have created a repressive and stagnant galactic government. In the present Imperium, science and Human progress have essentially been halted in service to the need to simply maintain the crumbling status quo. It is not for nothing that many Imperial scholars consider the current age the \"[Time of Ending](/wiki/Time_of_Ending \"Time of Ending\")\" for Mankind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several [alien](/wiki/Alien \"Alien\") species and dark mystical forces -- [Chaos](/wiki/Chaos \"Chaos\"), the [Tyranids](/wiki/Tyranids \"Tyranids\"), the [Craftworld Aeldari](/wiki/Craftworld_Aeldari \"Craftworld Aeldari\"), the [Drukhari](/wiki/Drukhari \"Drukhari\"), the [Orks](/wiki/Orks \"Orks\"), the [T'au](/wiki/T%27au \"T'au\"), and the undying [Necrons](/wiki/Necrons \"Necrons\") -- now challenge the supremacy of the Imperium and Humanity's predominant place in the galaxy. From within its own creaking and increasingly stagnant and repressive edifice, the Imperium is threatened more insidiously by rebellion, [mutation](/wiki/Mutation \"Mutation\"), dangerous [psykers](/wiki/Psykers \"Psykers\") and subversive [Chaos Cults](/wiki/Chaos_Cults \"Chaos Cults\").\n",
      "\n",
      "However, despite its myriad problems, without the admittedly authoritarian and often harsh protection of the Imperium, Mankind as a whole would have fallen prey to the countless perils that threaten it. Without the Imperium of Man and Mankind's faith in the Emperor who guides it, the Human species would have become extinct long ago.\n",

      "The [Human](/wiki/Human \"Human\") race of the 41st Millennium bears deep scars upon their collective psyche thanks to the horrors of the [Age of Strife](/wiki/Age_of_Strife \"Age of Strife\"), which ground on for almost six standard millennia. Mankind survived its ravages in only the most fragmented and desperate fashion, emerging from its shadows and into the [Emperor](/wiki/Emperor \"Emperor\")'s light as a species much changed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The collapse of Humanity's intersteallar society during the Age of Strife brought a violent end to millennia of Human confidence. It completely shattered the species' prior sense of galactic destiny. Never before had there been a peril or challenge Human ingenuity could not best. Worse, the dangers that laid Mankind low came from within, unmarked until it was too late.\n",
      "\n",
      "The damage done to the gestalt Human psyche by thousands of Terran years of galactic catastrophe ran so deep as to become instinct; mistrust of curiosity\n",
      "and invention, of alien influence and psychic witchcraft predominated. Humanity became closed-minded and violently conservative, desperate to avoid repetition of the mistakes that had led to the horrors and intense suffering of the Age of Strife. Where lore and record-keeping failed, mythology and religion kept those fears alive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps this explains the fervour with which the Emperor's [Great Crusade](/wiki/Great_Crusade \"Great Crusade\") was greeted. Though of course countless warlords and isolationist societies fought His rule, the Emperor's unification of the Human-settled [galaxy](/wiki/Galaxy \"Galaxy\") brought a safe and secular comfort that banished the ghosts haunting the Human soul. If this is true then it would also explain why the Emperor's fall during the [Horus Heresy](/wiki/Horus_Heresy \"Horus Heresy\") saw those spectres rush back in with such vengeance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fearful and bereft of the Emperor's conscious guidance after His interment within the [Golden Throne](/wiki/Golden_Throne \"Golden Throne\"), Humanity sought strength in the blind zealotry that the Emperor Himself had so assiduously discouraged through the spread of the [Imperial Truth](/wiki/Imperial_Truth \"Imperial Truth\"), becoming ever more entrenched in their superstitions over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Age of Strife even scarred the galaxy itself. Countless worlds were reduced to inimical wastelands or overrun by dangerous living weapons. Others were\n",
      "left haunted by the cyclopean ruins of lost endeavour, vast haloes of decaying orbital machinery, looming spires crackling with strange energies, echoing techvaults still concealing deadly threats behind bulkheads buried in the dust of ages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every time the Imperium discovers another such remnant of Humanity's former glory it is but another reminder of the hubris that damned Mankind, and the dangers of daring to hope in such a dark and terrible age as the 41st Millennium.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Technophobia\n",
      "\n",
      "The Imperium of the 41st Millennium is a deeply superstitious society, its people bound in shackles of ignorance and blinded against dangerous truths. Atavistic terror and religious disgust characterise its attitudes to scientific and technological innovation, stemming from the barely remembered, apocalyptic horrors of the [Age of Technology](/wiki/Age_of_Technology \"Age of Technology\") and [Age of Strife](/wiki/Age_of_Strife \"Age of Strife\").\n",
      "\n",
      "Advanced science and technology is but dimly understood by the mass of [Humanity](/wiki/Humanity \"Humanity\"). Be they erudite scholars, military heroes, the pilots of voidcraft or ragged serfs, the majority of Mankind attributes the operation of technology to fickle, animistic [Machine Spirits](/wiki/Machine_Spirit \"Machine Spirit\") that must be beseeched with the proper rituals of activation and appeased with offerings of sanctified oil, sacred unguents and the like.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only the [magi](/wiki/Magi \"Magi\") of the [Adeptus Mechanicus](/wiki/Adeptus_Mechanicus \"Adeptus Mechanicus\") possess true repositories of technological and scientific lore. They hoard all they have gathered in towering data-stacks deep within the industrial sprawls of their fortified factory-planets known as [Forge Worlds](/wiki/Forge_World \"Forge World\"). Yet even these insular [tech-priests](/wiki/Tech-priest \"Tech-priest\") make no distinction between technical blueprint and sacred scripture, electronic component and holy relic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their prayers are delivered in blaring [binharic cant](/wiki/Cant_Mechanicus \"Cant Mechanicus\"), their repairs conducted as incense-wreathed rituals and the construction of their revered machines performed by rote rather than understanding. Experimentation, innovation and invention are considered tantamount to [heresy](/wiki/Heresy \"Heresy\").\n",
      "\n",
      "The doctrines of their [Machine God](/wiki/Machine_God \"Machine God\") -- the deity whose physical manifestation is the [Emperor](/wiki/Emperor \"Emperor\") or \"[Omnissiah](/wiki/Omnissiah \"Omnissiah\")\" -- grew out of the terrors of the [Age of Strife](/wiki/Age_of_Strife \"Age of Strife\") and warn of the dangers of rampant innovation. Knowledge lost to the ravages of time remains lost, for the terror of [tech-heresy](/wiki/Tech-heresy \"Tech-heresy\") -- or at least, of its discovery and the subsequent punishment -- is greater by far than the dread of ignorance.\n",
      "\n",
      "For all this the Adeptus Mechanicus holds vast power in the Imperium, which is reliant upon advanced technology to survive. There is a reason that worship of the Omnissiah is the only officially tolerated religion besides the [Imperial Creed](/wiki/Imperial_Creed \"Imperial Creed\"). Nor do the Adeptus Mechanicus view the acquisition of lost technologies --[archeotech](/wiki/Archeotech \"Archeotech\") -- to be in any way equivalent to the sin of fashioning devices anew.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is an irony long lost on the tech-priests that they hunt rapaciously for even the slightest fragments of ancient Human artifice, many of which are examples of the very [Dark Age](/wiki/Dark_Age_of_Technology \"Dark Age of Technology\") technology so reviled by their own creeds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such relics of the Omnissiah are viewed as sacred treasures; entire armies are readily sacrificed to ensure their acquisition. Most precious of all are the remnants of [Standard Template Construct](/wiki/Standard_Template_Construct \"Standard Template Construct\") machines that have survived the long [Terran](/wiki/Terran \"Terran\") millennia. These remarkable STC databases allow auto-fabrication of devices that Humanity can well use in their war for survival; many of the Imperium's most ubiquitous weapons and war engines are still produced in this fashion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Imperial Creed is as damming of unsanctioned technology as it is of [mutation](/wiki/Mutation \"Mutation\") or rebellion against the Emperor. Many allegorical parables warn against the horrors of [artificial general intelligence](/wiki/Silica_Animus \"Silica Animus\"); such \"thinking machines\" are regarded with horror, and are banned even amongst the Adeptus Mechanicus.\n",
      "\n",
      "The average Imperial citizen views tech-heresy as akin to [witchcraft](/wiki/Witch \"Witch\"), and reacts with equal intolerance to either. Some Human worlds play host to ancient sites where the remains of Dark Age technology lurk, but these are shunned as cursed by those forced to live in their shadows. [Xenos](/wiki/Xenos \"Xenos\") technology is even further mistrusted; even the most replicable and [galaxy](/wiki/Galaxy \"Galaxy\")-changing innovations are typically shunned if they are of [alien](/wiki/Alien \"Alien\") origin. There are exceptions; dangerous archeotech sometimes finds its way up from the lawless roots of [hive cities](/wiki/Hive_cities \"Hive cities\") or mine workings after being excavated by labour gangs.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Frontier World](/wiki/Frontier_World \"Frontier World\") colonists -- who take a more pragmatic approach to survival than those who live on the more settled worlds of the Imperium -- trade with neighbouring xenos species, and in so doing introduce xenotech to the sprawling Imperial [black markets](/wiki/Cold_Trade \"Cold Trade\"). Such dangerous prizes are sought out by various ordos of the [Inquisition](/wiki/Inquisition \"Inquisition\"), of course, as are their suppliers, for the damage that these deviant devices can cause in the wrong hands does not bear imagining.\n",

To them, Mankind is in a fallen state from the height of its powers during the [Dark Age of Technology](/wiki/Dark_Age_of_Technology \"Dark Age of Technology\"), when the secrets of the universe were known to all. Knowledge then, lies in the past and the Adeptus Mechanicus will go to any lengths to uncover the great secrets of antiquity, scouring the universe for any scrap of information from their holy book -- the lost [Standard Template Construct](/wiki/Standard_Template_Construct \"Standard Template Construct\") database system. They hold that, were the knowledge contained within the ancient STC database to be restored in full, it would reveal all of the powers of the hallowed past. The Tech-priests venerate machines and regard them as superior to flesh. Many of them believe that the Machine God desires them to shed this weakness and so they often sport numerous [bionic](/wiki/Bionic \"Bionic\") modifications. These mechanical enhancements add to their air of otherness and further help to set them apart from the rest of Humanity. Through rune and hammer, the Tech-adepts are the wards of the arcane and they guard their knowledge jealously. But for all their might, they are not beyond the watchful gaze of the Inquisition.\n",

      "* The **[Adeptus Custodes](/wiki/Adeptus_Custodes \"Adeptus Custodes\")** are the genetically-engineered superhumans who serve as the guardians of the Emperor's physical form. They are essentially the Emperor's bodyguards and royal guardsmen within the [Imperial Palace](/wiki/Imperial_Palace \"Imperial Palace\") on [Terra](/wiki/Terra \"Terra\") and they are considered the greatest warriors of the Imperium, more powerful than even the [Astartes](/wiki/Astartes \"Astartes\") of the [Space Marines](/wiki/Space_Marines \"Space Marines\"). However, despite their skill in battle they very rarely ever venture beyond the confines of Terra. These are among the mightiest warriors in all the Imperium, the praetorians of the Emperor. They stand ever-vigilant outside the brazen doors which seal His holy chamber. They are entirely beyond reproach and they are among the few in the Imperium over whom the Inquisition has no power. They never leave the inner sanctums of the [Imperial Palace](/wiki/Imperial_Palace \"Imperial Palace\") and serve from birth to death within its hallowed halls. Yet they are among the few servants of Mankind who will ever look upon the Emperor directly, and for that they receive blessings beyond all measure.\n",

It is given to them to maintain order amongst the higher echelons of Imperial governance -- wherever a Planetary Governor seeks to abuse his rule, wherever populist unrest seeks to unseat the rightful dominion of the Imperium, wherever thoughts of personal gain at the Emperor's expense cross the minds of the ruling classes, there you will find the dogged agents of the Lawgivers. The Arbites enforces Imperial Law across the galaxy and its Arbitrators possess the right to serve as judge, jury and executioners on every Imperial world.\n",

      "* **[Holy Ordos of the Emperor's Inquisition](/wiki/Holy_Ordos_of_the_Emperor%27s_Inquisition \"Holy Ordos of the Emperor's Inquisition\")** - The Imperium is assailed by countless enemies both from within, without and beyond the boundaries of reality. The attentions of unclean [xenos](/wiki/Xenos \"Xenos\"), the invidious influences of the misguided followers of the [Ruinous Powers](/wiki/Ruinous_Powers \"Ruinous Powers\"), planetary unrest, [mutation](/wiki/Mutation \"Mutation\"), rogue [psykers](/wiki/Psykers \"Psykers\"), rebellious Imperial lords and more all work constantly to bring the Imperium down, which will lead to the ultimate extinction of [Mankind](/wiki/Mankind \"Mankind\"). Yet somehow it survives and Humanity endures. The Inquisition is one of the many reasons for the persistence of Man in an extremely hostile universe. Known as the \"left hand of the Emperor,\" the Inquisition, itself not officially a part of the Adeptus Terra but standing above it, operates across the Imperium and beyond to suppress and eliminate those forces that would destroy the holy dominion of Mankind over the galaxy. Inquisitors are empowered to go anywhere and do anything -- whatever they must to ensure the survival of the Imperium and Humanity. Their [Inquisitorial Rosettes](/wiki/Inquisitorial_Rosette \"Inquisitorial Rosette\") open all doors, and even the vaunted [planetary governors](/wiki/Planetary_governor \"Planetary governor\") must acquiesce to their demands without complaint or delay, lest they be themselves regarded as suspect. They will commit acts, no matter how vile, to maintain the unchanging integrity of the Imperium, and they will put whole planets to death in order to see that this is so. The members of the Inquisition vary enormously in physical appearance, methodology and mentality. Some operate alone and in secret, hidden from the eyes of the common man, while others operate openly and carry dozens of [Acolytes](/wiki/Acolyte \"Acolyte\") and agents in their cadre. What they do have in common is that they answer only to their order, and each order answers only to the Emperor. Their efforts can be checked by no adepta and they are utterly, fanatically devoted to the defence of the Imperium. Even the most loyal and honest Imperial citizen is likely to break into a cold sweat on learning that the Inquisition is nearby -- and that suits its members perfectly. The Inquisition is itself divided into three major orders or \"ordos\": the [Ordo Malleus](/wiki/Ordo_Malleus \"Ordo Malleus\"), which hunts [Daemons](/wiki/Daemon \"Daemon\") and those corrupted by the [Ruinous Powers](/wiki/Ruinous_Powers \"Ruinous Powers\") of [Chaos](/wiki/Chaos \"Chaos\"); the [Ordo Xenos](/wiki/Ordo_Xenos \"Ordo Xenos\") which eliminates the threat that other intelligent [alien](/wiki/Alien \"Alien\") civilisations present to Humanity's rule of the galaxy; and the [Ordo Hereticus](/wiki/Ordo_Hereticus \"Ordo Hereticus\") which hunts down [mutants](/wiki/Mutants \"Mutants\"), [witches](/wiki/Witches \"Witches\"), [Heretics](/wiki/Heretic \"Heretic\") of the [Imperial Cult](/wiki/Imperial_Cult \"Imperial Cult\"), and all those who would threaten the Imperium from within -- including within the [Ecclesiarchy](/wiki/Ecclesiarchy \"Ecclesiarchy\") itself. The Inquisition's agents necessarily exist and operate beyond the control of the [Adeptus Terra](/wiki/Adeptus_Terra \"Adeptus Terra\"), since part of the Inquisition's role involves rooting out corruption and gross incompetence from within the highest levels of the Imperium itself. Inquisitors ultimately answer only to the Emperor and to themselves and they are perhaps the most powerful organisation within the Imperium after the [Chapters](/wiki/Chapters \"Chapters\") of the [Adeptus Astartes](/wiki/Adeptus_Astartes \"Adeptus Astartes\").\n",

      "* The **[Adeptus Ministorum](/wiki/Adeptus_Ministorum \"Adeptus Ministorum\")** is the ecclesiastical hierarchy of the [Imperial Cult](/wiki/Imperial_Cult \"Imperial Cult\") that serves as the state church of the Imperium and promulgates and maintains control of the [Imperial Creed](/wiki/Imperial_Creed \"Imperial Creed\") and the galaxy-spanning faith of the God-Emperor of Mankind. The Adeptus Ministorum is not formally part of the Adeptus Terra. Rather it is a sister organisation which works hand-in-glove with the Priesthood of Earth. The Adeptus Ministorum derives its power and authority from the common Imperial belief in the Emperor's divinity. Also known as the [Ecclesiarchy](/wiki/Ecclesiarchy \"Ecclesiarchy\"), after its high priest, the ruling [ecclesiarch](/wiki/Ecclesiarch \"Ecclesiarch\"), the Adeptus Ministorum is vast and powerful. Its duty is to guide and interpret the innumerable ways that Humanity has found to worship the Emperor, shepherding the myriad worlds of Man along the unsteady path that lies between heresy and true devotion. Whole worlds lie within its administration and on many others it represents the most powerful Imperial institution. Like the Administratum, the Ecclesiarchy is a complex and byzantine organisation. A bewildering hierarchy of [priests](/wiki/Priest \"Priest\"), [confessors](/wiki/Confessor \"Confessor\"), [cardinals](/wiki/Cardinal \"Cardinal\"), novices, clerics, bishops and [missionaries](/wiki/Missionary \"Missionary\") all owe fealty to the Ecclesiarch in the Ecclesiarchical Palace on Terra. Just as varied are the various roles within the Ministorum, from wandering Missionaries, to charismatic preachers and theosophical scholars. Two of the most famous institutions within the Adeptus Ministorum are the training orphanages of the *[Schola Progenium](/wiki/Schola_Progenium \"Schola Progenium\")* and the battle-sisters of the [Orders Militant](/wiki/Orders_Militant \"Orders Militant\") of the [Adepta Sororitas](/wiki/Adepta_Sororitas \"Adepta Sororitas\").\n",

      "[Mankind](/wiki/Mankind \"Mankind\") has always excelled at the art of war, and the [Emperor](/wiki/Emperor \"Emperor\")'s armies are spread across the [galaxy](/wiki/Galaxy \"Galaxy\"). The threat or effects of war are never far away, no matter where you go in the Imperium. Mankind seeks to purge the stars of its enemies, and the bloody carnage it wreaks in doing so shows no sign of abating. The Imperium's military is at once mighty, glorious and terrible. Some of the most important military forces of the Imperium include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **[Astra Militarum](/wiki/Astra_Militarum \"Astra Militarum\")** - The Astra Militarum or \"[Imperial Guard](/wiki/Imperial_Guard \"Imperial Guard\")\" is the backbone of the Imperium's military might. Millions upon millions of well-trained men and women, organised into thousands of regiments, make up the Guard. With [Lasgun](/wiki/Lasgun \"Lasgun\") and bayonet they march upon alien battlefields and garrison vital worlds. They form the Imperium's first line of defence and they strike the first blow in many Imperial Crusades. Its regiments are drawn in great tithes of manpower from the Imperium's worlds and each regiment has a unique cultural character and fighting tradition, from the rigid discipline of the [Armageddon Steel Legion](/wiki/Armageddon_Steel_Legion \"Armageddon Steel Legion\") to the stealthy brutality of the pale-skinned Stygians and the unflinching bravery of the [Vostroyans](/wiki/Vostroyan_Firstborn \"Vostroyan Firstborn\"). Vast conscript armies, elite special forces, massive tank columns and glorious sabre-wielding, animal-riding [cavalry](/wiki/Rough_Rider \"Rough Rider\") can all be found in the Imperial Guard, often fighting alongside one another on Emperor-forsaken worlds they have never heard of. Regiments do not remain on their homeworlds but are raised explicitly to be sent to fight and die light years away from home. And they do die, for the Imperial Guard bear the weight of the Imperium's wars. It is said that the Emperor knows the name of every soldier that has fallen fighting in His wars -- but if that is true, He is the only one who can comprehend just how many Imperial Guardsmen have died in the ten thousand years since the Emperor \"ascended\" to the [Golden Throne](/wiki/Golden_Throne \"Golden Throne\"). Those who survive the grinding horrors of a lifetime of war are frequently gifted a portion of the very land they fought to conquer as a reward. As with many things in the Imperium, this is a mixed blessing indeed. The Imperial Guard regiments are raised from the local armies of the Imperium's worlds as part of a planet's tithe to the Imperium. These regiments are normally deployed according to the orders of the [Adeptus Terra](/wiki/Adeptus_Terra \"Adeptus Terra\"). However, when the [High Lords of Terra](/wiki/High_Lords_of_Terra \"High Lords of Terra\") declare a major military campaign (often referred to as a \"Crusade\") they appoint a [Warmaster](/wiki/Warmaster \"Warmaster\") chosen from among high-ranking Imperial Guard officers to command the campaign's regiments. One of the most famous Warmasters, [Macharius](/wiki/Macharius \"Macharius\"), was given the title \"Lord Solar\" when he became the Imperial Commander of the entire [Segmentum Solar](/wiki/Segmentum_Solar \"Segmentum Solar\"). Macharius proved to be the greatest Imperial general since the [Horus Heresy](/wiki/Horus_Heresy \"Horus Heresy\") when he conquered a thousand worlds on the Imperium's [Eastern Fringe](/wiki/Eastern_Fringe \"Eastern Fringe\") and expanded the Imperium to the very edge of the [Astronomican](/wiki/Astronomican \"Astronomican\")'s reach.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **[Adeptus Astartes](/wiki/Adeptus_Astartes \"Adeptus Astartes\")** - The Adeptus Astartes, better known as the [Space Marines](/wiki/Space_Marines \"Space Marines\"), are the elite, transhuman warriors of the Imperium. They are few in number and regarded with almost mythical awe by most folk, for they are inheritors of traditions founded by the Emperor Himself. The Space Marines are divided into [Chapters](/wiki/Chapters \"Chapters\"), each possessing 1,000 Astartes along with its own support staff and starfleet. It is said that there are around a thousand such Chapters in the Imperium. A Space Marine is recruited in adolescence from among the most violent cultures of the Imperium. His body is hugely enhanced with new genetically-engineered organs promoting muscle and bone growth to give him immense strength, size and resilience. His mind is similarly enhanced; hypno-doctrination and sleep-learning give him both a fervent belief in the Imperium and the knowledge of weapons and tactics to bring the Emperor's wrath to the battlefield. Upon completing his augmentation and training (which not all Aspirants survive), he is issued with his wargear, including a suit of [Power Armour](/wiki/Power_Armour \"Power Armour\"). This armour is one of the most powerful symbols of Imperial might, depicted in statuary and stained-glass windows in cathedrals all across the Imperium. Equipped with nerve-fibre bundles so it moves in sync with his body, a Space Marine's armour not only grants him great strength and protection but is a work of art, resplendent in the heraldry of his Chapter. Each Chapter is independent from the [Adeptus Terra](/wiki/Adeptus_Terra \"Adeptus Terra\"). While most will eagerly answer the summons of an Imperial Warmaster or a plea for help from somewhere in the Imperium, some Chapters have their own agendas and cannot be relied upon entirely. All, however, serve the Emperor loyally with complete devotion. All Chapters have proud traditions and distinct characteristics that translate into the way they fight. The ferocious [Space Wolves](/wiki/Space_Wolves \"Space Wolves\"), for instance, are more fiercely independent from the Adeptus Terra than most other Chapters and fight on their own terms up close with [Chainswords](/wiki/Chainsword \"Chainsword\") and [Bolt Pistols](/wiki/Bolt_Pistol \"Bolt Pistol\"). The [Iron Hands](/wiki/Iron_Hands \"Iron Hands\"), on the other hand, have close ties to the [Adeptus Mechanicus](/wiki/Adeptus_Mechanicus \"Adeptus Mechanicus\") and are the masters of siege warfare, arming their warriors with an array of devastating heavy weapons and tanks. Many Chapters are legends, and names such as the [Blood Angels](/wiki/Blood_Angels \"Blood Angels\"), [Ultramarines](/wiki/Ultramarines \"Ultramarines\"), [Dark Angels](/wiki/Dark_Angels \"Dark Angels\") and [Imperial Fists](/wiki/Imperial_Fists \"Imperial Fists\") are spoken of with reverent awe among Imperial citizens. A Space Marine Chapter has its own fleet of fast spacecraft and can react far more quickly to a threat than the Imperial Guard or Imperial Navy, making the Adeptus Astartes one of the only forces in the Imperium that can mount a rapid response to a crisis. The Space Marines are extremely few in number compared to the size of the Imperium and few citizens will ever see one in the flesh, but without them the Imperial military and the Human species would slide ever faster towards destruction.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **[Grey Knights](/wiki/Grey_Knights \"Grey Knights\")** - The [Space Marines](/wiki/Space_Marines \"Space Marines\") of the Grey Knights Chapter are amongst the most highly specialised of the Adeptus Astartes, designed to specifically defend the Imperium against the threat of [Chaos](/wiki/Chaos \"Chaos\"). The Grey Knights are permanently attached to the [Ordo Malleus](/wiki/Ordo_Malleus \"Ordo Malleus\") as its [Chamber Militant](/wiki/Chamber_Militant \"Chamber Militant\") and their leaders are rumoured to serve terms as members of the Inner Conclave of the [Inquisition](/wiki/Inquisition \"Inquisition\"). No ordinary warriors, Grey Knights are chosen from amongst the most fearsome and savage feral cultures, each one an emergent [psyker](/wiki/Psyker \"Psyker\") who has undergone arduous tests of faith, strength, endurance and courage that would break all but the strongest. Grey Knights fight in baroque, heavily ornamented suits of Power Armour, carrying mighty sigil-encrusted swords and halberds. These warriors alone can stand before the might of a [Greater Daemon](/wiki/Greater_Daemon \"Greater Daemon\") with any hope of banishing it back to the [Warp](/wiki/Warp \"Warp\"). The millennia the Grey Knights have spent in battle against the [Forces of Chaos](/wiki/Forces_of_Chaos \"Forces of Chaos\") has furnished them with blasphemous knowledge, painstakingly pieced together by the Inquisitors of the Ordo Malleus. Each warrior carries a copy of the sacred *Liber Daemonica*, the holy battle rites of the Chapter, in a [Ceramite](/wiki/Ceramite \"Ceramite\") case on his breastplate, and it is this tome which symbolises a Grey Knight's most potent weapon: his unshakable faith in the Divine Emperor of Mankind. For above all else, the Emperor protects...\n",
      "\n",
      "* **[Deathwatch](/wiki/Deathwatch \"Deathwatch\")** - The Space Marines of the Deathwatch are mysterious figures who battle in black [Power Armour](/wiki/Power_Armour \"Power Armour\"), fighting with preternatural skill and dedication against the most terrible of alien creatures or [xenos](/wiki/Xenos \"Xenos\"), as they are called in the Imperium. They usually appear without warning and vanish as quickly as they arrived, leaving no trace of themselves or of the creatures they have fought. These are the Imperium’s most highly trained xenos fighters, known simply as the Deathwatch. Forming the [Chamber Militant](/wiki/Chamber_Militant \"Chamber Militant\") of the Inquisition's [Ordo Xenos](/wiki/Ordo_Xenos \"Ordo Xenos\"), the Deathwatch uniquely draws its members from across the many different [Space Marine](/wiki/Space_Marine \"Space Marine\") [Chapters](/wiki/Chapters \"Chapters\"), all of which have sworn sacred oaths to maintain specially trained xenos fighters and stand ready to deploy them at a moment’s notice when the Inquisition requests their aid. These specialised warriors are drawn together as and when needed by the Ordo to combat alien menaces whenever and wherever it rears its vile head. Rumour has it that Ordo Xenos maintains a number of secret fortresses at the fringes of the Imperium where the Deathwatch keeps a silent and constant vigil, ever watchful for the tell-tale signs of alien encroachment.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **[Collegia Titanica](/wiki/Collegia_Titanica \"Collegia Titanica\")** - The Collegia Titanica is the division of the [Adeptus Mechanicus](/wiki/Adeptus_Mechanicus \"Adeptus Mechanicus\") that includes the Legions composed of [Titans](/wiki/Imperial_Titan \"Imperial Titan\"), the colossal Imperial robotic war machines that are the most powerful engines of war in the Imperium of Man. The Collegia is also more rarely known as the [Adeptus Titanicus](/wiki/Adeptus_Titanicus \"Adeptus Titanicus\") (a contraction of \"Adeptus Mechanicus Collegia Titanica\").\n",

      "* **[Sisters of Battle](/wiki/Sisters_of_Battle \"Sisters of Battle\") ([Orders Militant](/wiki/Orders_Militant \"Orders Militant\") of the [Adepta Sororitas](/wiki/Adepta_Sororitas \"Adepta Sororitas\"))** - The [Orders Militant](/wiki/Orders_Militant \"Orders Militant\") of the [Adepta Sororitas](/wiki/Adepta_Sororitas \"Adepta Sororitas\"), also known as the \"Sisters of Battle,\" are an all-female division of the [Imperial Cult](/wiki/Imperial_Cult \"Imperial Cult\")'s ecclesiastical organisation known as the [Ecclesiarchy](/wiki/Ecclesiarchy \"Ecclesiarchy\") or, more formally, as the [Adeptus Ministorum](/wiki/Adeptus_Ministorum \"Adeptus Ministorum\"). The Sisterhood's Orders Militant serve as the Ecclesiarchy's fighting arm, mercilessly rooting out corruption and heresy within Humanity and every organisation of the [Adeptus Terra](/wiki/Adeptus_Terra \"Adeptus Terra\"). There is naturally some overlap between the duties of the Sisterhood and the Imperial [Inquisition](/wiki/Inquisition \"Inquisition\"); for this reason, although the Inquisition and the Sisterhood remain entirely separate organisations, the Orders Militant of the Sisterhood also act as the [Chamber Militant](/wiki/Chamber_Militant \"Chamber Militant\") of the Inquisition's [Ordo Hereticus](/wiki/Ordo_Hereticus \"Ordo Hereticus\"). The Adepta Sororitas and the Sisters of Battle are commonly regarded as the same organisation, but the latter title technically refers only to the Orders Militant of the Adepta Sororitas, the best-known part of the Adepta. The Sisterhood serves as the Ministorum's only official military force because the [Decree Passive](/wiki/Decree_Passive \"Decree Passive\") laid down by the reformist [Ecclesiarch](/wiki/Ecclesiarch \"Ecclesiarch\") Sebastian Thor held that in the wake of the [Age of Apostasy](/wiki/Age_of_Apostasy \"Age of Apostasy\") of the 36th Millennium, the Ecclesiarchy cannot maintain any \"men under arms.\" This was supposed to limit the power of the Ecclesiarchy. However, the Ministorum were able to circumvent this decree by using the all-female force of the Sisterhood.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **[Navis Imperialis](/wiki/Navis_Imperialis \"Navis Imperialis\")** - The [Imperial Navy](/wiki/Imperial_Navy \"Imperial Navy\") holds nearly all of the Imperium's fighting starships; local governments, Warmasters and others are forbidden to maintain their own fleets of warships. Their spacecraft include some of the most potent engines of destruction in the whole galaxy, including mighty [Battleships](/wiki/Battleship \"Battleship\") thousands of years old. The Navy's starships range from small [Escorts](/wiki/Escort \"Escort\") with a crew of a few dozen to the immense [*Emperor*-class Battleships](/wiki/Emperor-class_Battleship \"Emperor-class Battleship\") which might have 20,000 souls or more on board. The Navy also includes fighter and bomber crews and aircraft of the division known as the *[Aeronautica Imperialis](/wiki/Aeronautica_Imperialis \"Aeronautica Imperialis\")* that support the forces of the Astra Militarum on the ground. The Navy's officer class is highly traditional and aristocratic in character. The Imperium's noble families frequently boast naval officers among their number and naval dynasties dominate many battlefleets. Elitism is a virtue on most ships, where the officers' lives are in stark contrast to those of the ratings and engine crews. With thousands of crew living and dying on ships that can spend solar decades without seeing port, a ship of the Imperial Navy becomes a city in space. Mutinies are not unknown and the Naval security battalions of Armsmen are a familiar sight on the decks of all naval ships, their black visors and [Shotguns](/wiki/Shotgun \"Shotgun\") constantly reminding the men that obedience is their duty to the Emperor. The Navy relies on many other organisations to function. Perhaps most importantly, these ancient and complex vessels could not function without a complement of [Tech-priests](/wiki/Tech-priests \"Tech-priests\") who know how to appease the starships' [Machine Spirits](/wiki/Machine_Spirit \"Machine Spirit\") and maintain technology that is too old and mysterious to be replicated. The Navy is also reliant on the Tech-priests of Mars for refits, upgrades, repairs and new starships. It is usual for a warship to have Astropaths on board, for proper communication is essential if the Imperium is to be defended. Many captains are glad to have Ministorum clergy among their crew, ministering to the spiritual needs of the men and steeling their spirits with sermons. [Commissars](/wiki/Commissar \"Commissar\") are appointed to the larger ships, watching over the moral fibre of the crew and providing a watch against mutiny and impiety. Then, of course, there is the [Navigator](/wiki/Navigator \"Navigator\") of each vessel, whose family can occupy entire spires jutting out into space atop the ship.\n",

      "* **[Skitarii Legions](/wiki/Skitarii_Legions \"Skitarii Legions\")**, the ***[Legio Cybernetica](/wiki/Legio_Cybernetica \"Legio Cybernetica\")***, **[Imperial Knights](/wiki/Imperial_Knight \"Imperial Knight\")** and squads of **[Combat Servitors](/wiki/Servitor \"Servitor\")** - These are several types of autonomous military ground forces deployed by the [Adeptus Mechanicus](/wiki/Adeptus_Mechanicus \"Adeptus Mechanicus\") to protect their [Forge Worlds](/wiki/Forge_Worlds \"Forge Worlds\") and to assist Imperial military campaigns when necessary.\n",

Though the Ordo Tempestus is technically a sub-faction governed by the [Adeptus Administratum](/wiki/Adeptus_Administratum \"Adeptus Administratum\"), it enjoys a far greater amount of autonomy than the Imperial Guard regiments that often fight alongside it. The Ordo's ranks are primarily comprised of [commissars](/wiki/Commissars \"Commissars\") and the special forces troops known as [Tempestus Scions](/wiki/Tempestus_Scions \"Tempestus Scions\") or \"[Storm Troopers](/wiki/Storm_Troopers \"Storm Troopers\")\" in [Low Gothic](/wiki/Low_Gothic \"Low Gothic\"), though they have often included specialist factions mysteriously absent from Imperial records. In every theatre of war across the galaxy, the Ordo's men work alongside the incalculable might of the Astra Militarum, their elite training complementing the sheer manpower of the Imperial Guard. The regiments of the Tempestus Scions, no matter how skilled, do not form the main body of the Astra Militarum, for that duty falls to the regular Imperial Guardsmen. Instead they can be likened to a knife, a thrusting point of lethal force that is applied with shocking speed into the foe's weakest point. Many a grinding war of attrition or extended campaign has been brought to a dramatic close by a strike force of Tempestus Scions. More often than not, their insertion, mission completion and extraction parameters are all accomplished on the same day.\n",

      "* **[Inquisitorial Storm Troopers](/wiki/Inquisitorial_Storm_Troopers \"Inquisitorial Storm Troopers\")** - The [Inquisition](/wiki/Inquisition \"Inquisition\") maintains its own own corps of highly-trained special operations forces who are similar in training, tactics and wargear to the [Militarum Tempestus](/wiki/Militarum_Tempestus \"Militarum Tempestus\")' elite [Tempestus Scions](/wiki/Tempestus_Scions \"Tempestus Scions\") that guard the secret installations of the Inquisition. The Inquisition maintains a number of fortresses throughout the [galaxy](/wiki/Galaxy \"Galaxy\"), both secret and known to the inhabitants of the Imperium. Inquisitorial Storm Troopers are used by the Imperial Inquisition to guard their fortresses and the [Black Ships](/wiki/Black_Ships \"Black Ships\") as they make their purity runs across the Imperium's [sectors](/wiki/Sector \"Sector\"), and they can also augment an individual [Inquisitor](/wiki/Inquisitor \"Inquisitor\")'s personal retinues of [Acolytes](/wiki/Acolytes \"Acolytes\") with reliable and effective soldiers. Many Storm Troopers of particular skill are chosen to become an Inquisitor's [Throne Agents](/wiki/Throne_Agents \"Throne Agents\"). Inquisitorial Storm Troopers are selected from families with a record of unwavering faith in the [Emperor](/wiki/Emperor \"Emperor\") and prior duty to the Inquisition, usually from the *[Schola Progenium](/wiki/Schola_Progenium \"Schola Progenium\")*, just like their standard Tempestus Scion counterparts. They are trained and equipped in a manner similar to Ordo Tempestus Storm Troopers, albeit lacking the rapid insertion and infiltration skills, as they are not expected to undertake such types of missions which are more often carried out for the Inquisition by the [Officio Assassinorum](/wiki/Officio_Assassinorum \"Officio Assassinorum\").\n",

      "The [Imperial Cult](/wiki/Imperial_Cult \"Imperial Cult\") is one of the few common factors that link the disparate worlds of the Imperium together. No matter what conditions prevail upon a world within the Imperium, the Imperial Cult will be found there. The ways in which the Emperor is worshipped in Human space are multitudinous. To some He is revered as a distant, patriarchal and Human figure. Others identify Him with some aspect of nature, many others, such as the primitive Epheisians of Dwimlicht, regard Him as a Star God, for His agents only visit occasionally and they descend from the heavens when they do so. But all the creeds of the Cult agree upon this one thing: there is only one God-Emperor. To worship a pantheon of hods and put other gods alongside Him is heresy. However, there have been many individuals over the millennia who have been seen as His [saints](/wiki/Imperial_Saint \"Imperial Saint\"), people visibly touched by the Emperor, and they are venerated all over the Imperium. There are saints for every aspect of life and there is a thriving trade in their relics on many worlds.\n",
      "\n",
      "The worship of the God-Emperor is, in the main, highly organised across the Imperium. Cathedral complexes can be found in the capitals of all worlds of any meaningful populations. On the densely populated, teeming [Hive Worlds](/wiki/Hive_World \"Hive World\"), these can occupy entire spires. The graceful structure of the Cathedral of the Emperor Triumphant, constructed after the [Second War for Armageddon](/wiki/Second_War_for_Armageddon \"Second War for Armageddon\") at Hive Primus on [Armageddon](/wiki/Armageddon \"Armageddon\"), climbs delicately skyward, its main tower nearly a full kilometre in height. The statue of the Emperor at the top brushes the planet's troposphere, looking benignly down upon the seething, polluted Hive World below. Most towns will have a church or temple dedicated to the Emperor and even the crudest village of the most primitive tribesman will sport a sacred cave or grove dedicated to His name. Of course, in some places, the worship of the Emperor supercedes all other aspects of life -- these are the [Shrine Worlds](/wiki/Shrine_Worlds \"Shrine Worlds\") of the Imperium, where perhaps one of the great saints, or even, in the distant past, the Emperor Himself, performed a great deed.\n",
      "\n",
      "These planets can be one, vast, religious complex, or huge cemetery worlds such as Granithor, where the wealthy spend vast fortunes bringing the dead scions of their families for burial, usually those who have perished in the service of the Emperor. Then there are the [Cardinal Worlds](/wiki/Cardinal_World \"Cardinal World\"), which attract millions of pilgrims and are the strongholds of the Imperial Cult. These planets are directly governed by the [Ecclesiarchy](/wiki/Ecclesiarchy \"Ecclesiarchy\") and are the seats of functionaries high in the Cult, responsible for the spiritual health of vast areas of Human space. The Ecclesiarchy maintains and promotes the Cult galaxy-wide and, where possible, tries to sanction the worship of the Emperor no matter how bizarre it may seem. Very few practices are proscribed, and even such abominations as Human sacrifice to the Emperor are useful to the Imperium, for it is easy to convince a newly encountered culture that approves of such custom to give up its [psykers](/wiki/Psykers \"Psykers\") to the [Black Ships](/wiki/Black_Ships \"Black Ships\").\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the Ecclesiarchy's tasks is to record this multiplicity of tradition with which the Emperor is honoured. In that way, two [Preachers](/wiki/Preacher \"Preacher\") from opposite sides of the galaxy will know, no matter what their title or manner of expressing their devotion might be, that neither is a [Heretic](/wiki/Heretic \"Heretic\"). The Ecclesiarchy sends out mission fleets for precisely this purpose, whose flotillas of blessed spacecraft slowly circle a particular part of the galaxy, recording new variants of the Cult, correcting serious heresies and proselytising to newly discovered populations of Humans. To all, the Emperor is a living god. He may be tens of thousands of light years away, but that He exists, the inhabitants of the Imperium know, so faith is an easier thing in the 41st Millennium than it has been at other times in Human history. Some amongst the [Ecclesiarchy](/wiki/Ecclesiarchy \"Ecclesiarchy\") and [Inquisition](/wiki/Inquisition \"Inquisition\") may argue that men should be more ardent in their devotion to Him, but though some may be lax in their adulation and may blaspheme or heretically curse the Master of Mankind for their lot, it is nevertheless rare to meet a man who would dare to deny the Emperor's divinity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ecclesiarchy presides over the souls of the Imperium's citizens, dividing its countless dioceses into parishes, some of which are centred upon a particular planet, others focused to tending to a particular locale or holy shrine. Each parish is ministered by a priest called a Preacher, seeing to the well-being and purity of his flock's souls. It is their duty to watch for deviancy and ensure that heretical belief is purged wherever it lurks. A truly pious Preacher may rise to become a Pontifex, whose authority extends over several parishes and their Preachers. The responsibilities of a Pontifex are diverse and can encompass the protection and ministration of routes of pilgrimage, the consideration of beatitudes and recommendation of canonisation to the holy synods. The priests called Confessors are the booming voices of the Ecclesiarchy, exalting the faithful to deeds of penitence, fervour and righteousness. Confessors are not charged with the ministrations of a diocese, but rather roam the Imperium at-will wherever the hand of the God-Emperor calls them. Under the spell of a Confessor a city can burn at the hands of its own citizens, armies may jubilantly throw themselves into the waiting guns of an enemies' hands and Heretics flee, fearing their holy wrath.\n",

The higher ranks in this administrative system are usually combined with a basic planetary governorship as well as interstellar duties. Each of these governors is usually a member of the Imperial [nobility](/wiki/Highborn \"Highborn\") and it is rare, but not impossible, for a man or woman born in the lowest ranks of Imperial society to rise to the rank of an Imperial Governor on his or her own merits or abilities rather than inherit the role.

      "Because of the distances involved and the unstable nature of Warp communication, Planetary Governors generally operate very autonomously. This allows quite a lot of variation in the regional governments of the Imperium. Some governorships are hereditary, but it is also possible for a planet to have an elected Planetary Governor, a tyrant Governor who rules solely by force of his personal arms, or anything in between. So long as the Governor fulfills his duties to the broader Imperium, his rule will generally be accepted by the higher authorities with little or no interference.\n",

These Governors are often isolated from their subjects, sometimes even living on orbital installations, only interfering to control mutation, Chaos incursions, Ork invasions and rogue psykers, as well as to collect the modest tithes in men for the Astra Militarum and psykers that these planets provide. The Imperial duties of a Planetary Governor include paying the planetary tithe to the Administratum, controlling psykers, mutation and [heresy](/wiki/Heresy \"Heresy\") among the population, defending the planet and putting down rebellions against the local government (and thus against the Imperium). A serious responsibility for a Planetary Governor is the maintenance of an adequate local military force capable of defending the planet in the event of an invasion. The [Planetary Defence Forces](/wiki/Planetary_Defence_Force \"Planetary Defence Force\") (PDF) are expected to defeat attacks from minor foes, and in the case of major invasions to hold out until reinforcements arrive, which could take a period of solar months, standard years or even solar decades.\n",
      "\n",
      "A relatively small number of Imperial worlds are not ruled by a Planetary Governor, but are directly overseen by an alternate organisation such as the [Adeptus Terra](/wiki/Adeptus_Terra \"Adeptus Terra\"), the [Ecclesiarchy](/wiki/Ecclesiarchy \"Ecclesiarchy\"), an Imperial Commander of the [Astra Militarum](/wiki/Astra_Militarum \"Astra Militarum\") or a [Chapter](/wiki/Chapter \"Chapter\") of the [Adeptus Astartes](/wiki/Adeptus_Astartes \"Adeptus Astartes\"). These planets include the [Forge Worlds](/wiki/Forge_World \"Forge World\") of the [Adeptus Mechanicus](/wiki/Adeptus_Mechanicus \"Adeptus Mechanicus\"), whose inhabitants toil without pause to manufacture the weapons of the Emperor's armies (including [Mars](/wiki/Mars \"Mars\"), [Gryphonne IV](/wiki/Gryphonne_IV \"Gryphonne IV\") and [Fortis Binary](/wiki/Fortis_Binary \"Fortis Binary\")), the [Cardinal Worlds](/wiki/Cardinal_World \"Cardinal World\") of the Ecclesiarchy, which are given entirely over to education of the priesthood and worship of the Emperor (Ignatius Cardinal, [Ophelia VII](/wiki/Ophelia_VII \"Ophelia VII\")), and the [Space Marine Chapter homeworlds](/wiki/Space_Marine_Chapter_Homeworld \"Space Marine Chapter Homeworld\"), such as [Fenris](/wiki/Fenris \"Fenris\"), [Macragge](/wiki/Macragge \"Macragge\"), [Baal](/wiki/Baal \"Baal\"), or [Medusa](/wiki/Medusa \"Medusa\").\n",

      "Just as the environments and cultures of Imperial worlds vary immensely, so too does the way they are governed. The Imperium allows most of its worlds to govern themselves, using whatever method of government the population gravitates towards or was the traditional form of rule. Some are hereditary monarchies, others are ruled by aristocracies or warlords. Some are ruled by elected parliaments, while on others power is given to whoever can pay for it. On some worlds these are the same thing. Upon other planets, such things as democracy, free choice and even individual civil rights are present, though these worlds are few and far between. Some worlds are administered directly by the various Adepta, such as [Agri-worlds](/wiki/Agri-world \"Agri-world\") run by the Administratum or [Cardinal Worlds](/wiki/Cardinal_World \"Cardinal World\") ruled by the [Ecclesiarchy](/wiki/Ecclesiarchy \"Ecclesiarchy\"). Whilst the individual nation-states, city-states, tribes, corporations, hegemonies, peoples’ work collectives, and so on, may have their own various leaders, the Adeptus Terra will always look to one person to fulfil the planet's [Imperial Tithe](/wiki/Imperial_Tithe \"Imperial Tithe\") and obligations to the Imperium. Titles for this governor vary from planet to planet. In some cases the person judged responsible for the Imperial Tithe may not even be aware that this is the case until too late. Certainly, more than one titular head of state has discovered this upon rejoining the Imperium after a period of isolation through [Warp Storm](/wiki/Warp_Storm \"Warp Storm\"), war or other calamity.\n",
      "\n",
      "All Imperial Governors are expected to recognise the authority of the Imperium and the Emperor and to uphold His laws. These responsibilities include aiding the agents of the [Adeptus Arbites](/wiki/Adeptus_Arbites \"Adeptus Arbites\") and the [Inquisition](/wiki/Inquisition \"Inquisition\"), as well as arranging the allotted tithes for the Administratum. Governors are also expected to yield [psykers](/wiki/Psykers \"Psykers\") up to the [Black Ships](/wiki/Black_Ships \"Black Ships\") of the Inquisition when required and to keep the population free of [mutants](/wiki/Mutants \"Mutants\"), [Chaos Cultists](/wiki/Chaos_Cult \"Chaos Cult\"), [Heretics](/wiki/Heretic \"Heretic\"), political radicals and [witches](/wiki/Witches \"Witches\"). In practice, some planets escape from these duties with relative ease, whilst others are placed under seemingly tyrannical restrictions. Due to the sheer size of the Imperium and the unpredictability of travel through the Warp, there are many occasions where the Administratum never manages to extract its levy, or the Black Ships never arrive at the appointed time to take psychic individuals away. Planets can be isolated for generations and it is not unusual to encounter worlds where the Imperial Tithe has been all but forgotten. Certainly the scribes of the Prol System have, in their vast libraries, several accounts of Administratum Logisters arriving at worlds lost for centuries, only to discover their yearly tithe burning on vast pyres as the natives offer their dues up to the sky.\n",

Other clusters of worlds might be connected by huge corporations, the powers of hereditary nobles, religious leaders or other such ties.

      "\n",
      "The peoples of the Imperium vary in their form and appearances just as their homeworlds do. Whilst there is a generally agreed baseline Human standard, consisting of four limbs, one head, twenty digits and so on, the local environment and genetic stock have caused all manner of interesting anomalies, evolutionary adaptations and fashions. These differences are usually cosmetic in effect; however, the more radical alterations walk the line between accepted variation and outright [mutation](/wiki/Mutant \"Mutant\"). It is a subject of intense debate amongst some Inquisitors, and indeed the priests of the [Ecclesiarchy](/wiki/Ecclesiarchy \"Ecclesiarchy\"), on what it is to be Human and therefore accepted into the Imperium.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certain planets will betray their colonial origins with the appearance of their peoples -- perhaps a particular type of nose or skin colour will be dominant. Others will have clear tribal divisions. Some populations will possess unusual adaptations as a consequence of their local environment. The folk of the Agri-world Dreah, for example, have a grey skin, hair and eye tone, which exactly matches the flora, fauna, sky and waters of their notoriously dull planet. Some cultures may impose certain ideals of beauty that drastically alter the looks of their peoples. Certainly, many strange and terrible gangs of Underhivers have been discovered, clad in hyper-fashionable armour, sporting glowing [Electoos](/wiki/Electoo \"Electoo\"), skull studs, gang tribal mutilations and shiv scars with pride.\n",
      "\n",
      "To some extent a similar appearance and culture binds the people of a planet together into a common stock. Usually speaking, citizens of the Imperium will prefer to spend their time with fellow natives of their world. That said, however, Mankind has ever been titillated by the exotic, so friendship, love affairs and even children with off-worlders is not unknown on planets with a culture that legitimises such travel.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Rebellion\n",
      "\n",
      "The [Imperial Creed](/wiki/Imperial_Creed \"Imperial Creed\") maintains that all of Humanity must be brought and kept within the Imperium where men and women can benefit from the rule of the Emperor. Several Imperial organisations are permanently occupied with suppressing any possibility of rebellion before it has a chance of developing. The common worship of the God-Emperor holds Mankind together and instills loyalty towards the Imperium. Rebellions and uprisings on Imperial planets nonetheless remain a constant problem. The nature and causes of a rebellion can fall into several categories: the government of an Imperial world may decide to secede from the Imperium; a popular uprising may attempt to overthrow the local Imperial government; in the most insidious of cases the rebellion may be brought about by [alien](/wiki/Alien \"Alien\") or [Chaos](/wiki/Chaos \"Chaos\") influence. In the more prosaic cases however, a new planetary government established through rebellion is not necessarily opposed by the Imperium, so long as it accedes fully to Imperial authority and pays its tithes to Terra. Besides the pursuit of outright war, there are many ways a rebellious world may be brought back into the Imperium. With the existence of its more secretive organs like the [Inquisition](/wiki/Inquisition \"Inquisition\"), the Imperium is fully capable of carrying out covert methods of restoring Imperial rule, including assassination, popular agitation, economic sabotage and terrorism. Sometimes a rebellion can be subdued by the removal of a single individual. Pro-Imperial groups or other anti-government forces can be infiltrated or supported as required.\n",

Sheer odds dictate that sooner or later those that frequently travel in ships between planets will experience such a disaster. Those worlds that have not lost the art of creating and maintaining slower-than-light starships jealously guard their arcane craft.

Vessels equipped with a functional [Warp-Drive](/wiki/Warp-Drive \"Warp-Drive\") are able to translate themselves into this other dimension of being that coexists with the material universe by generating an envelope of protective [Gellar Fields](/wiki/Gellar_Field \"Gellar Field\").

Time does not operate normally within this other realm and so travellers can emerge to discover that Terran centuries have passed in realspace since they started their journey, that they have merely been absent for a few solar seconds, or have even arrived before they left. Even skilled [Navigators](/wiki/Navigators \"Navigators\") cannot predict how much time will be lost, gained or repeated over the course of a journey. Those that embark upon Warp travel know that they will probably never return home, or that if they do so they will find it so changed that it is unrecognisable.

      "\n",
      "These messages are received by fellow Astropaths in various ways. Some appear as vague and troubling dreams, whilst others appear as visions or mystic portents. Others appear within whatever ritual method or divination technique the receiving psyker happens to practise. Thus warning of an [Ork](/wiki/Ork \"Ork\") invasion might appear as a glistening imperfection in fish entrails, a looming cloud of smoke, bleeding orifices or a worrying combination of runes or sigils within a holographic matrix. Astropathic messages must not only be transmitted from one Astropath to another but decoded at the other end. Each Astropath employs slightly different symbols and each has a preferred style or \"flavour.\" Some messages take solar weeks of poring over tomes of augurs and symbolism before they can be reconstructed, though the best Astropaths can do this word for word. Some remain a mystery forever. Some messages are received by Astropaths at entirely the wrong end of the galaxy and must be passed on to others who are nearer the place in question.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some messages simply do not get to their intended recipient or are drastically misinterpreted along the way. In addition, there are too few Astropaths. Most worlds, especially those with small populations or on the fringes of the Imperium, have no Astropaths at all, and must rely on the infrequent visits of passing [Chartist](/wiki/Chartist \"Chartist\") ships or Administratum census-takers to make contact with the outside galaxy at all. For this reason the [Adeptus Terra](/wiki/Adeptus_Terra \"Adeptus Terra\") cannot react quickly to every event in the Imperium, even when an event occurs that is great enough to attract the notice of the vast and ponderous Imperial bureaucracy. On most worlds, the Imperium feels very far away.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Imperium of Man originally used a special [Imperial Dating System](/wiki/Imperial_Dating_System \"Imperial Dating System\") derived from the original [Gregorian Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar) of Old Earth that denotes the current year by the notation *(year of the millennium)*.M*(number of the millennium)*. For example, the year 40,999 A.D. would be represented as 999.M41, while 41,002 would be 002.M42 and the year 2021 would be 021.M3. However, the year 41,000 A.D. would be 000.M41, since the new millennium starts at the year 001 and has no Year 0.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the wake of the resurrection of the [Primarch](/wiki/Primarch \"Primarch\") [Roboute Guilliman](/wiki/Roboute_Guilliman \"Roboute Guilliman\") and his return to the position of [Lord Commander of the Imperium](/wiki/Lord_Commander_of_the_Imperium \"Lord Commander of the Imperium\") and [Imperial Regent](/wiki/Imperial_Regent \"Imperial Regent\") in ca. 999.M41, he discovered that the Imperial Calendar had become degraded by both dogmatic adherence and thoughtless revisionism. Various rival dating systems had evolved from the Imperial Standard, making a true, accurate chronicle of the galaxy almost impossible to construct.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the [Indomitus Crusade](/wiki/Indomitus_Crusade \"Indomitus Crusade\")'s first phase drew to a close approximately twelve standard years into what would once have been designated the 42nd Millennium, Guilliman calculated the current year by the five main factional variants of the Imperial Calendar to be anywhere between the early 41st Millennium and an entire millennium later, and that was leaving out the numerous lesser, more heretical interpretations. As a result, most dates given in the 41st Millennium should be considered unreliable or approximations at best in relation to the period of the [Great Crusade](/wiki/Great_Crusade \"Great Crusade\") and the [Horus Heresy](/wiki/Horus_Heresy \"Horus Heresy\"), and many have argued that the Imperium is still in the midst of the 41st Millennium.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following the birth of the [Great Rift](/wiki/Great_Rift \"Great Rift\") and the start of the [Era Indomitus](/wiki/Era_Indomitus \"Era Indomitus\"), temporal anomalies spread across the [galaxy](/wiki/Galaxy \"Galaxy\") making the use of a universal dating system extremely difficult as different Imperial worlds began to experience the passage of time at different subjective rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "A new, more localised dating system came into existence that was different for each settled world or star system. It used the birth of the Great Rift as the standard event from which all time was calculated, either before or after its creation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Imperial Currency\n",
      "-----------------\n",
      "\n",
      "The economic systems in existence across Imperial space vary from world to world and their levels of technological progression and so there is no standardised financial system or [currency](/wiki/Currency \"Currency\") in use across the entire Imperium. On more primitive [Feral](/wiki/Feral_World \"Feral World\") and [Feudal Worlds](/wiki/Feudal_World \"Feudal World\"), there may be no system more complex than bartering or the exchange of a basic, precious metal-based currency.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, most civilised worlds that have achieved the standard level of Imperial technology make use of some form of fiat currency for all economic transactions which is often digital or electronic in form. The names of these currencies vary as wildly as the [Human](/wiki/Human \"Human\") cultures that employ them. Some are used only on individual [worlds](/wiki/Worlds \"Worlds\") or their surrounding sub-sectors, while on others the currency may be accepted on a [sector](/wiki/Sector \"Sector\")-wide or even multi-sector basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, the Imperial currency of the [Calixis Sector](/wiki/Calixis_Sector \"Calixis Sector\") and many of the surrounding regions such as the [Koronus Expanse](/wiki/Koronus_Expanse \"Koronus Expanse\") is known as the \"[Throne Gelt](/wiki/Throne_Gelt \"Throne Gelt\")\", embodied in the form of metallic coins known simply as \"[thrones](/wiki/Thrones \"Thrones\"),\" a reference to the [Emperor](/wiki/Emperor \"Emperor\")'s [Golden Throne](/wiki/Golden_Throne \"Golden Throne\"). This currency, like most in the Imperium, is a fiat currency based on the value of the local region's [Imperial Tithes](/wiki/Imperial_Tithe \"Imperial Tithe\"). There are also precious shell tokens or coins of rare or strategic metals that are accepted as legal tender on all of the civilised Imperial worlds of that sector. Thrones can also be dispersed in electronic form as payment, usually by using a [data-slate](/wiki/Data-slate \"Data-slate\").\n",

      "Threats to the Imperium\n",
      "-----------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite being the largest empire that Humanity has ever known, many planets within the Imperium feel isolated and alone in the deep void of space. Across all the peoples and planets of the Imperium, fear gnaws away at the psyche, worming mistrust and desperate faith into the conscious and unconscious mind. Time and again the universe has proved itself an uncaring and frightening place deeply hostile to the survival of Humanity. People fight one another, the [Warp](/wiki/Warp \"Warp\") rages, [xenos](/wiki/Xenos \"Xenos\") attack and worlds die. The people of the Imperium watch their neighbours for signs of heresy and witchery. Mankind prays to the Emperor to protect them from the woes of the universe, of which there are many.\n",

      "### Dark Gods and Daemons\n",
      "\n",
      "Time and again throughout history, the minds of Man have proven fertile soil for the seeds of corruption by [Chaos](/wiki/Chaos \"Chaos\"). There are certain dark powers abroad in the universe that seduce the weak and foolish into their damnable service. These ageless beings, their names unspeakable, prey upon Mankind's needs and desires. With honeyed words, forbidden knowledge, bloody rites and festering secrets they lure Humanity to become their slaves. Some within the Imperium choose to worship these Daemon Gods. The ways of these [Chaos Cults](/wiki/Chaos_Cults \"Chaos Cults\") are many. Some meet in clandestine rituals of sacrifice and incantation. Others are foolish scholars, meddling with powers beyond their ken. Others still are organisations, companies or political groups drunk with power gained through pacts with unspeakable creatures of the [Warp](/wiki/Warp \"Warp\"). Perhaps worst of all are the instances of entire worlds that worship the [Chaos Gods](/wiki/Chaos_Gods \"Chaos Gods\") through ignorance or choice. All of these profane cultists invite ruin upon themselves, the Imperium and Humanity. The [Adeptus Terra](/wiki/Adeptus_Terra \"Adeptus Terra\"), [Planetary Governors](/wiki/Planetary_Governor \"Planetary Governor\") and the [Inquisition](/wiki/Inquisition \"Inquisition\") all watch for these disciples of Chaos, for the inevitable consequence of their meddling is pain, disaster and bloodshed. The ordinary peoples of the Imperium rightly fear these cults and their malevolent masters. On many worlds an undercurrent of paranoia, suspicion and fear of Chaos Cultists is the norm.\n",
      "\n",
      "The very existence of such fell beings as the [daemons](/wiki/Daemons \"Daemons\") of the Warp is a terrible secret to most citizens of the Imperium, as the Imperium's rulers believe such truths must be hidden from the minds of those who would fall prey to them. A daemon is a Warp entity, a terrible creature of thought and psychic energy brought forth into existence by the twisted needs of sentient beings, or at least so the high masters of the [Ordo Malleus](/wiki/Ordo_Malleus \"Ordo Malleus\") say. To even think of them is to invite their attention and only the steeliest mind, the most powerful faith in the God-Emperor, is enough to overcome their utter, monstrous evil. Inconceivable as it may seem, there are those who would consort with the daemon, for they whisper dark things in the night to those who would listen and make many promises of temporal or eternal power. They can be brought forth willingly, by the [witch](/wiki/Witch \"Witch\") or by certain arcane sorceries, or they may try to force a way through into [realspace](/wiki/Realspace \"Realspace\") through the unsuspecting portal of an untrained [psyker](/wiki/Psyker \"Psyker\")'s mind. However they become incarnate, if they achieve their goal, just one daemon can bring ruination to all it encounters. One need not talk of the Night of Silence in Atraxian III's capital city, nor of the lost world of Abandoned Hope, which to this day is warded by the Inquisition, knowledge of its existence forbidden to all. Make no mistake, to face a daemon is to face damnation, to court a daemon is to embrace its dark masters.\n",

      "The degeneration of the holy Human form is one of the Ecclesiarchy's greatest concerns. Environmental pollution, deliberate genetic alteration, stellar radiation, alien diets and simple evolutionary adaptation have wrought manifold changes upon the genome and body of Man across his vast stellar empire. Some of these [mutants](/wiki/Mutants \"Mutants\") have a standard, stable, morphological type and are tolerated by the authorities -- notable among them being the [Abhuman](/wiki/Abhuman \"Abhuman\") [Ogryns](/wiki/Ogryn \"Ogryn\") and the ancient and noble [Navigators](/wiki/Navigators \"Navigators\"). But to find whole worlds where the Human population has no eyes due to never-ending darkness, or unusually long legs because of millennia of nomadic living, is not unusual. Whether these aberrant populations are declared acceptable or not is the business of the Adeptus Terra.\n",
      "\n",
      "But mutation can also be a sign of the influence of the [Ruinous Powers](/wiki/Ruinous_Powers \"Ruinous Powers\") of [Chaos](/wiki/Chaos \"Chaos\"). Just as they twist and destroy the minds and souls of Man, so too do they toy with his flesh, bending it into profane shapes, gifting strange abilities and creating monsters for their perverse amusement. Where such mutation is present, it is rightly abhorred. Few are willing to tolerate such an aberation within their midst and fear of mutants runs through the populations of many worlds, even those where such things have happened but once in a hundred generations. Perhaps worse still is the constant fear of becoming a mutant oneself. Many folk pray that should this worst of all things occur, they will have the strength to end their own lives, before the mob or the [Inquisition](/wiki/Inquisition \"Inquisition\") does it for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some poor fools are willing mutants, seeing the distortion of their flesh as a sign of favour from the Ruinous Powers. They seek out ways to gain more of these mutational \"gifts,\" either by begging the Dark Gods for more of their touch or by doing their bidding in the hope of further reward. Others, more poignantly, claim innocence of any wrong doing or foul worship. Whatever the case, a mutant is a mutant and must be feared, hated and destroyed. This is but one of the many reasons Imperial citizens tend to be highly intolerant and many innocent men, upon finding themselves on a new world, have been murdered by a frenzied mob for merely appearing to be different.\n",
      "\n",
      "The related question of witchcraft also exercises the minds of a great many of the Emperor's servants. Indeed, one whole arm of the Inquisition -- the [Ordo Hereticus](/wiki/Ordo_Hereticus \"Ordo Hereticus\") -- has the finding and destruction of these dangerous beings as one of its primary activities, and several other organisations exist to contain, exploit and control these Human psychics. It is said by a heretical few that Mankind stands upon the brink of a great evolutionary change in the species, that every standard year the incidence of [psykers](/wiki/Psykers \"Psykers\") rises and that one day the entirety of Mankind will become a new, psychic race much like the [Eldar](/wiki/Eldar \"Eldar\").\n",

It is a hidden danger that can spring up unbidden even inside a man's own family, and parents dread the birth of a witch child above all things. All psykers must be given over to the appropriate Imperial body or be purified by death.

But Man has ever been a fractious and fickle creature and not all agree that the Emperor's rule is to be desired. Therefore the rule of Terra must, by necessity, be harsh. The size of the Imperium means the grip of its governance must be loose, and rebellion is only regarded to have taken place when one of the various Imperial Tithes goes unpaid. Worlds which rise up to shake off the benevolent hand of the Emperor fall into one of the following four categories:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Governmental Revolt:** Occasionally the ruling body of an Imperial world might misguidedly decide that their planet would be far better off outside of the Imperium. They might not have been visited for a thousand Terran years or the [Planetary Governor](/wiki/Planetary_Governor \"Planetary Governor\") may harbour territorial ambitions of his own, but whatever their motivations, the result is the same -- ruthless and immediate repression. These revolts must be dealt with swiftly and graphic examples made of the ringleaders, for if just one planet is shown to succeed in such a quest, others will certainly follow. It may take centuries to quash a revolt, but no Human world is ever allowed allowed to secede for long from the Imperium. Assassination, planetary assault and, occasionally, *[Exterminatus](/wiki/Exterminatus \"Exterminatus\")* are all righteous tools that may be employed to bring the wayward world to heel.\n",
      "* **Popular Revolt:** It is a regrettable fact that many citizens of the Imperium suffer from the most horrendous living conditions in less-than-ideal environments. From time to time, a particularly bold demagogue may rally his fellows and overthrow a planetary government. This only becomes a problem if they then go on to defy the authority of the Imperium, otherwise the new regime will go unmolested -- it is ordinarily not the Adeptas' way to impose a specific governmental form upon a population. Foolishly, flush with success, the rebellious people of a world often go on to do just that, mistakenly identifying the Imperium with their oppression and not their salvation. Also, it is sometimes better on planets with a particular strategic importance to ensure continuance of a specific form of governance. In both these cases the military forces of the Imperium are brought to bear.\n",
      "* **Xenos Infiltration:** There are many creatures in the universe that exist by using other creatures as their proxy. These may be creatures from the physical realm, such as [Genestealers](/wiki/Genestealers \"Genestealers\"), or beings such as the [Enslavers](/wiki/Enslavers \"Enslavers\"), who somehow have a material being but dwell within the Empyrean. Sometimes these worlds carry on seemingly as normal, the rest of the galaxy unaware of the dark, alien cancer eating at their heart. As often as not, the alien-dominated population will rise up in armed rebellion. In either case, utter destruction of the infested inhabitants is, regrettably, the best course of action. This can be effected via *[Exterminatus](/wiki/Exterminatus \"Exterminatus\")*, through tectonic destabilisation, the use of [Cyclonic Torpedoes](/wiki/Cyclonic_Torpedo \"Cyclonic Torpedo\") or [viral (general or geno-tailored) bombardment](/wiki/Virus_Bomb \"Virus Bomb\"), dependant upon the importance of the world and the possibilities for subsequent recolonisation.\n",
      "* **Daemonic Infiltration:** A planet may turn to worship of the Dark Gods under a number of circumstances. Suppression of such revolts must be handled carefully -- destruction of the population may be the [Ruinous Powers](/wiki/Ruinous_Powers \"Ruinous Powers\")' actual aim, as the psychic feedback in the Immaterium caused by the sudden deaths of millions of people can be enough to permanently open a rift between the [Warp](/wiki/Warp \"Warp\") and [realspace](/wiki/Realspace \"Realspace\"). Planetary invasion by specialist formations like the [Space Marines](/wiki/Space_Marines \"Space Marines\") or the [Grey Knights](/wiki/Grey_Knights \"Grey Knights\") is advisable, followed immediately by planetary cleansing or destruction through *[Exterminatus](/wiki/Exterminatus \"Exterminatus\")*.\n",
